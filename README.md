## Technologies

For this project we use Jupyter notebook in PyViz ecosystem for making visualizations in Python.


* [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) - an extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based on the Jupyter Notebook and Architecture

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive 

* [sklearn](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/01/scikit-learn-python-machine-learning-tool/) - machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction

* [tensorflow](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/deep-learning-tutorial/what-is-tensorflow) - is an open-source library developed by Google primarily for deep learning applications

* [keras](https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/) - is a Python library for developing and evaluating deep learning models

## Instalation Guide

Before opening the Jupyter notebook, you need to install:

```python
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```

to verify installation:

```python
python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.__version__)"
```

Keras is included with TensorFlow 2.0

```python
python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.keras.__version__)"
```
